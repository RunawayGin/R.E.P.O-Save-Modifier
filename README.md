## Overview

R.E.P.O Save Modifier provides a user-friendly graphical interface to load, modify, and save your Repo game progress. It decrypts the game's `.Es3` save files, allows you to edit various parameters, and then re-encrypts them for use in the game.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Load & Decrypt:** Automatically detects Repo save files in the default location (`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\semiwork\Repo\saves`) or allows browsing for `.Es3` files. Decrypts save files using the game's standard encryption method.


*   **Edit Game Data:**
    *   **Game Stats:** Modify current level, currency, lives, charging station charge, and total haul value (in thousands)
    *   **Team Name:** Change your team's name.
    
*   **Edit Player Data:**
    *   **Player Stats:** Adjust individual player health.
    *   **Player Upgrades:** Modify levels for all player upgrades (Health, Stamina, Speed, Strength, Jump, Range, etc.).
  
*   **Edit Items:**
    *   Modify quantities of purchased items (Weapons, Grenades, Utility, etc.).
    *   Modify levels of purchased upgrade items.
  
*   **Player Management:**
    *   **Add Players:** Add new players to the save using their 17-digit Steam ID.
    *   **Steam Integration:** Automatically fetches player usernames and avatars from Steam Community profiles.
    *   **User Cache:** Remembers previously added players for quick re-adding across different saves.
    
*   **Save & Encrypt:** Encrypts the modified data back into the `.Es3` format compatible with the game.
*   **Automatic Backups:** Creates a `.backup` copy of the original save file before overwriting.
*   **Modern UI:** Clean and intuitive interface built with PySide6, featuring custom widgets and theming.

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

*   **Python:** 3.8 or newer
*   **Operating System:** Primarily tested on Windows (due to default save path detection). May work on other systems if save files are browsed manually.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `PySide6`: For the graphical user interface.
    *   `pycryptodomex`: For AES encryption/decryption.
    *   `requests`: For fetching Steam profile data.

## Installation üíæ

You can either download a pre-built release (if available) or run from source.

**1. From Release (Recommended)**

*   Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/repo-save-modifier/releases) page of this repository. <!-- Update link -->
*   Download the latest release suitable for your operating system (e.g., `.exe` for Windows).
*   Run the downloaded executable.

**2. From Source**

*   **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-save-modifier.git <!-- Update link -->
    cd repo-save-modifier
    ```
*   **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the environment
    # Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can generate it from the source files or install manually: `pip install PySide6 pycryptodomex requests`)*
*   **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage üöÄ

1.  **Launch:** Run the application (`main.py` or the executable).
2.  **Load Save:**
    *   The application attempts to automatically list save files found in the default Repo save directory. Select a save from the list on the **Home** page and click "Load Selected Save".
    *   Alternatively, click "Browse Files" to manually locate and open an `.Es3` save file.
3.  **Edit:**
    *   Navigate through the sidebar tabs (**Game Stats**, **Player Stats**, **Items**) to view and modify data.
    *   Use the provided input fields, sliders, and buttons to make changes.
4.  **Add Players (Optional):**
    *   Go to the **Player Stats** tab.
    *   Click "Add Player".
    *   Use the dialog to select cached users or add a new user by fetching their data via Steam ID.
5.  **Save Changes:**
    *   Click the "Save Changes" button in the sidebar.
    *   Your modifications will be saved to the loaded `.Es3` file, and a backup of the original file will be created with a `.backup` extension in the same directory.
6.  **Exit:** Close the application.

## Technical Details ü§ì

*   **Encryption:** The application uses AES-128-CBC for encryption/decryption, deriving the key from the game's default password and the file's Initialization Vector (IV) using PBKDF2 (HMAC-SHA1).
*   **Compression:** Handles GZip compression/decompression if present in the save data.
*   **Steam API:** Fetches public profile data (`?xml=1`) from `steamcommunity.com` to get usernames and avatar URLs. Avatar images are cached locally in `resources/cache`.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

The automatic backup feature is provided, but it's always a good idea to manually back up your saves before making significant changes. This tool is not affiliated with the developers of Repo.
